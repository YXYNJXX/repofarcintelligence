                <p>The Great Depression started from 1929 to 1941, and still remains one of the most significant economic downfalls in American history. Established from a series of economic imbalances and the stock market crash of October 1929, it led to extreme unemployment, poverty, and social upheaval. This section provided the information of causes, impacts, and government interventions during the Great Depression.</p>

                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li><strong>Stock Market Crash of 1929:</strong> The stock market crash in October 1929, established on October 24th of Black Thursday and October 29th of Black Tuesday, started a chain reaction that destabilized the American economy. 16 million shares were sold on Black Thursday which wiped out billions of dollars. Speculative investments, purchasing on margin, and the lack of the regulation has led to the financial crisis in the end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Imbalances:</strong> Despite economic growth during the 1920s, the inequality of income was extreme. Even though the industrial workers saw potential improvements, wages have failed to keep pace with the economic expansion. Wealth was concentrated among a small percentile of Americans, causing the majority unable to afford goods and services that were necessary for living.</li>
                    <li><strong>Overproduction and Underconsumption:</strong> The farmers and factories produced goods faster than they could be consumed, causing oversupply in a sharp decline in prices, leaving producers with unsold, remaining inventories and plummeting profits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependence on Credit:</strong> Credit became a lifeline for American consumers and businesses during the 1920s. Installment buying allowed consumers to purchase goods they could not afford, causing mounting personal and corporate debt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Disasters:</strong> Natural disasters such as the Dust Bowl deteriorated the struggles of rural farmers. Severe droughts and unsustainable farming methods left much of the Great Plains barren, forcing multiple families to abandon their farms.</li>

                    <li><strong>Bank Failures:</strong> Between 1929 and 1931, multiple banks failed as panicked depositors withdrew their savings. Without the federal insurance for deposits, many Americans lost their life savings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unemployment:</strong> By 1933, unemployment had soared to 25% or more, leaving millions without a source of income. Even those who retained their jobs have faced significant wage cuts and reduced hours of working.</li>
                    <li><strong>Homelessness and Poverty:</strong> Since people were unable to afford housing, many families were forced into makeshift shelters in shantytowns called “Hoovervilles.” This community has become symbols of the widespread economic despair as well.</li>

Programs such as Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) created jobs and provided direct aid to the citizens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Recovery Initiatives:</strong> The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) addressed oversupply by encouraging farmers to reduce production. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) transformed the Tennessee Valley by regulating floods and generating electricity, boosting rural economies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structural Reforms:</strong> In order to stabilize the financial system, the New Deal introduced regulations such as creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect the bank deposits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Security Act:</strong> In 1935, Roosevelt introduced the Social Security Act, establishing pensions for retirees, unemployment insurance, and support for vulnerable populations. This legislation laid the foundation for America’s modern welfare state.</li>

                <p>The Great Depression was a transformative period in American history. It exposed the vulnerabilities of unregulated capitalism, experimented the resilience of the Americans, and redeifned the role of a government.
